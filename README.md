# Reinforcement Learning Course.
## Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a crucial field in artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on how agents learn to make decisions in an environment by interacting with it and receiving feedback. The goal of RL is to determine an optimal policy that enables the agent to maximize the cumulative reward over time.
## This is a course in FPT University. I will push my labs, notebooks and reports on this repo.
